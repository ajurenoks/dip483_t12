# Machine Learning-Based Job Recommendation System

## Objective
To develop a system that recommends jobs to users based on their profiles and preferences using machine learning techniques.

## Description
This project involves designing and implementing a job recommendation system. The system will use user profiles and job listings to suggest the most suitable jobs for each user.

## Requirements

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Gather Dataset**: Obtain a dataset of job listings and user profiles. This can be publicly available or synthetic.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize text, and extract relevant features.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Define Features**: Focus on job requirements, skills, experience levels, and user preferences.
- **Data Transformation**: Implement techniques like one-hot encoding, TF-IDF to prepare data for ML models.

### 3. Model Selection and Training
- **Explore Algorithms**: Consider collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, neural networks, etc.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Train the model(s) using the training set.

### 4. Recommendation Engine Development
- **Develop Engine**: Create a system that inputs user profiles and outputs job recommendations.
- **Ranking System**: Implement a ranking mechanism for job relevance.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Use precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the system.
- **Testing**: Analyze results using the testing dataset.

### 6. User Interface (Optional)
- **Create UI**: Develop a simple interface for profile input and job recommendation display.

## Deliverables

### 1. Code Repository
- **Source Code**: Include well-documented code and setup instructions.

### 2. Report
- **Documentation**: Cover methodology, algorithms, architecture, and results.
- **Challenges and Improvements**: Discuss any difficulties and potential enhancements.


## Evaluation Criteria
- Algorithm efficiency and correctness.
- Code and documentation quality.
- System accuracy and performance.
- Feature engineering and UI design creativity (if applicable).
- Analytical depth in report.
